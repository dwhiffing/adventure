Bosses:
  How can bosses be designed?






  detect user agent to determine device

user different vars for creation of graphics if on mobile

fix bugs:

  pieces swap with empty space instead of taped piece

  game is blurry and slow on mobile

  generate new tiles to fill empty spaces

    tiles could rise from the bottom like aurora feint

    rise slowly toward spiked ceiling

    game is over if any rise to the top

    game speeds up over time

  how to lose game?

    is it timed?

    is it life based?
